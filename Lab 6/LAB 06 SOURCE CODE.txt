	*Purpose: Computes the sum of N + N-1 up to 0 --> and average of that sum

	// LAB 6 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 1
	-------------------------

	Write a program that calls a function calculateSum to calculate the sum from 0 to N integers. 
	The function calculateSum has one parameter N of type integer and returns an integer which represents the sum from 0 to N, inclusive. 

	Write another function calculateAverage that calculates an average. 
	This function will have two parameters: the sum and the number of items. It returns the average (of type float). 

	The main function should be responsible for all inputs and outputs. 
	Your functions will only calculate and return the values and NOT print anything.  
	N is provided by the user; user input must be asked for repeatedly until a negative integer is provided.

	EX: INPUT IS 3, OUTPUT IS 3+2+1+0=6
	ANY NEGATIVE # SHOULD BE SIGNAL TO EXIT PROGRAM
	*hint, can use counter-controlled for loop
	*be careful for 0 sum average (divide by 0 parameter); should always be divide by 1 or greater since even N=0 means sum=0; average = 0/1 = 0.

	cout << "Begin by entering an integer value that is greater than or equal to 0 (integer >=0),\n" <<
			"The program will determine the sum and the average of that sum\n\n";
	cout << "for example: N = 3 --> SUM = 3+2+1+0 = 6, and AVERAGE = 6/4 = 1.5" << endl;

	*Purpose: Outputs a C shape of specified user input character

	// LAB 6 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 2
	-------------------------
	

	Write a program that prompts users to enter:

	o	The character to use (any character besides *) //don't use this for your test cases
	o	The width of the display
	o	The height of the display

	to produce a C shape.  This is an example for width of 10 and height of 9

	*        
	*        
	*        
	*        
	**********

	You must use separate functions to display the vertical and the horizontal lines.


	*CALL TO HORZ, THEN VERT, THEN HORZ FUNCTION AGAIN.
	*BE SURE TO DO HEIGHT MINUS TWO SINCE TWO HORZ FUNCTIONS ACCOUNT FOR 2 OF THE HIEGHT UNITS

	*Modification Date: 19 Feb. 2020
	*Purpose: Use int& (call by reference) to write functions and use functon call to change int main() values

	// LAB 6 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 3
	-------------------------
	PASS BY REFERENCE
	-------------------------
	Consider the following functions:

	void doIt(int &a, int b)
	{
		a = a + 5;
		b = b + 5
	}

	void doIt2(int a, int& b)
	{
		a += 5;
		b += 5
	}

	void doIt3(int & a, int& b)
	{
		a = a + 5;
		b += 5
	}

	Fix any errors in the above functions and write a main program that prompts the user for two integer numbers (num1 and num2). 
	Then, the main program calls the functions doIt, doIt2, and doIt3 with num1 and num2 as parameters. 
	The main program will print the content of num1 and num2 to the screen after each function is called. 
	Add an addendum to the test plan to explain for each function the difference between a and b.

	*addendum = add some paragraphs to the test cases (an additional section) to explain what happens with the a and b for each function call. 
	CAN PICK ONE TEST CASE AND ADD ADENDUM FOR THAT ONE TEST CASE EXPLAINING WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR EACH FUNCTION AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A AND B
