	*Purpose: Display who is the winner (or if it is a tie) between two basketball teams

	// LAB 5 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 3
	-------------------------

	Write a program that prompts users for the name and number of points of two basketball teams. 
	Then, it uses a nested if to display the winner (if any)
	or a message stating a tie if both teams have 
	the same number of points – One screen shot per scenario – use one function 
	to determine the possible scenarios.

	(input for two teams, team 1 and team 2, then you must figure out who is the winner and display who is the winner (or if it is a tie)
