	*Purpose: Tell the user what to do based on a given input temperature (F)

	// LAB 4 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 1

	The following program asks the user for the current temperature (in Fahrenheit).  
	Add a series of if statements (if with multiple alternatives i.e. if/else if/else) 
	So that one of the following messages is printed based on the temperature value:

	Temperature (F)							Message
	>90                                    "Go swimming."
	<=90, >80                              "Turn on air conditioning."
	<=80, >70                              "Do nothing."
	<=70, >55                              "Turn on heat."
	<=55, >30                              "Wear a heavy coat."
	<=30, >0                               "Wear gloves."
	<=0                                    "Stay inside, make a fire."

	*Purpose: Display a message based on user input of a valid letter grade

	// LAB 4 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 2

	Use a switch statement to write the following program:

	The program prompts the user for a letter grade (of type char). The list of valid letter grades is:
	A	B	C	D	E	F

	The program should consider both lower and upper case

	The program will then display the following messages:
	For grade 'A': display "Excellent"
	For grade 'B': display "Good"
	For Grade 'C': display "Average"
	For grade 'D' or 'E': display "Below Average"
	For Grade 'F': display "Fail"
	For any other letter grade entered by users: display "Invalid Grade"

	*Purpose: See what happens to variables when using ++ prefix versus ++ postfix operators

	// LAB 4 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 3

	Run the following code and explain, using your own words, 
	what is happening with each variable (w,x,y,z) 
	and what is the difference between ++x  and w++ 
	(is there any influence on the result between prefix or postfix ++ operator?). 
	Provide a snippet of the output showing the result.

	*Purpose: Calculate sum of N integers entered by user - using a 'for' loop

	// LAB 4 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 4--1 - forLoop

	Use a for loop to write a program that calculates the sum of N integers entered by the user. 
	N is a computer generated random number between 5 and 15 (both inclusive).
	1.	Repeat the program using a while loop

	Note: Use the following libraries for rand(),srand(), and time() support.

	#include <cstdlib> (random numbers library)
	#include <ctime> (used for time function)

	Use this for setting a seed: srand(time(NULL))

	Use this for generating a random number: rand()  (restrict random number 5-15  inclusive) (loop rand() val number of times)

	*Purpose: Print a triangle of Nth height provided by user input for N (N is for height of triangle)

	Question 5

	Prompt the user for a character and the height of a right triangle. 
	Then, print a triangle of that height using the symbol entered.  
	The Nth line of the triangle should contain N copies of the symbol. 
	Validate that the height entered is > 0.

	Hint: Use nested loops
