//MAKE SURE TXT FILES ARE IN SAME FOLDER AS .CPP FILES.
//EVERY TIME YOU RUN YOUR PROGRAM THE OUTPUT FILE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN,
SO TAKE SCREENSHOT OF RESULTS.TXT FILE BEFORE RUNNING PROGRAM AGAIN, OR
CREATE MULTIPLE RESULTS FILES AND JUST CHANGE THE NAME IN THE PROGRAM
TO OUTPUT RESULTS INTO RESULTS_2.TXT..ETC.

//so for screenshot: 
put: console window, input file, output file -- all lined up next to each other

//DO NOT NEED TO UPLOAD .TXT FILES..TA WILL GRADE BASED ON WHAT IS IN SCREENSHOT 
AND TEST TABLE
//REMEBER, DEFAULT FOR OUTPUT FILE IS THAT THE C++ WILL AUTO-CREATE A FILE???
