	*Purpose: A program that computes the weekly salary of each employee

	// LAB 7 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 1
	-------------------------


	Consider a text file that you will create named "employees.txt".  The file contains data organized according to the following format:

	John     Smith      10     15
	Sarah    Johnson  	40     12
	Mary     Taylor	    27	   13
	Jim      Stewart    25	    8

	For instance, "John" is the first name, "Smith" is the last name, "20" is the number of hours per week, and "9" is the hourly rate.

	Write a program that computes the weekly salary of each employee. 
	The program prints the first name, last name, and weekly salary of each employee in a file named "results.txt". 
	The "results.txt" must be created automatically by your program. 
	You must use a function to read/process the data from the input file and this function must have parameters. 
	The "employees.txt" file must be opened from main and read from within your defined function.

	*Purpose: Calculates and displays the average and high score of all students by reading the data from the named file the user provided

	// LAB 7 - CIS 150 - MEECH.cpp

	Question 2
	-------------------------
	
	Consider a file with the following student information:

	John		Smith		99
	Sarah		Johnson		85
	Jim			Robinson	70
	Mary		Anderson	100
	Michael		Jackson		92

	Each line in the file contains the first name, last name, and test score of a student.

	Write a program that prompts the user for the file name, 
	then calculates and displays the average score of all students by reading the data from the named file the user provided.
	You should use a function to read/process the data from the file and this function must have parameters and should use call by reference. 
	Your program should also present the highest score in class. The average and highest scores must be determined within your function. 
	However, the display of the average and highest scores must be done in main.
